</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
    <li> tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
    <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water,<br>
        stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain,<br>
        toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly<br>
        browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2<br>
        tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet.<br>
        Add chopped onion and cook
        over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook <br>
        until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
    <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat<br>
        through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs<br>
        and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set.<br>
        Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and<br>
        pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty). </li>
    <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese<br>
        at the table.
    </li>
</ol>
